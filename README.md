# Project Description

This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing airline-related information, including tweet data, sentiment scores, and additional details. The objective is to perform sentiment analysis on the provided dataset and evaluate the accuracy of sentiment predictions.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of several columns, including:

- `tweet_id`: Unique identifier for each tweet.
- `airline_sentiment`: The sentiment of the tweet (positive, negative, or neutral).
- `airline_sentiment_confidence`: Confidence level in the sentiment classification.
- `negativereason`: The reason for negative sentiment.
- `negativereason_confidence`: Confidence level in the negative sentiment reason.
- `airline`: The airline associated with the tweet.
- `airline_sentiment_gold`: Gold sentiment label for a subset of tweets.
- `name`: The name of the user who posted the tweet.
- `negativereason_gold`: Gold negative sentiment reason for a subset of tweets.
- `retweet_count`: The number of retweets for the tweet.
- `text`: The content of the tweet.
- `tweet_coord`: Coordinates associated with the tweet.
- `tweet_created`: Timestamp of tweet creation.
- `tweet_location`: Location of the user when posting the tweet.
- `user_timezone`: Timezone of the user posting the tweet.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: The dataset is loaded and explored to gain insights into its structure and content.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values and converting text data into a suitable format for analysis.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment analysis is performed on the text data to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

4. **Evaluation**: The accuracy of sentiment predictions is evaluated to assess the performance of the sentiment analysis model.

## Conclusion

The project involves the analysis of airline-related tweets to determine sentiment scores. By performing sentiment analysis, we gain valuable insights into customer opinions and can assess the overall sentiment towards different airlines. The accuracy of sentiment predictions serves as a measure of the model's effectiveness in classifying tweets, which can be valuable for understanding customer feedback and improving airline services.

The accuracy of sentiment predictions achieved in this project is approximately 73.06%. This analysis can provide airlines with valuable feedback and insights to enhance customer satisfaction and address areas of concern.
